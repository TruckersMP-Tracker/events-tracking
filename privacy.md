# TruckersMP Tracker - Events Tracking Privacy Policy

## Effective Date: 13/12/2023

### Overview

This Privacy Policy outlines the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of user information by TruckersMP Tracker ("we," "us," or "our") specifically for our Events Tracking service. By utilising our services, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

### Information Collection

#### Event Tracking Data

We collect event-related data, including player movements, bans, and other pertinent details. Refer to our [Event Tracking System documentation](https://github.com/TruckersMP-Tracker/events-tracking) for a detailed understanding of the data collected.

#### Compressed Data

Post-event, raw data is compressed into a more readable version for per-player accessibility, stored separately from raw data. An example of the compressed data can be found [here](https://github.com/TruckersMP-Tracker/events-tracking/blob/main/json/examples/event_test/compressed_test_doc.json).

### Data Storage and Retention

Raw data is retained for 30 days, followed by anonymisation or deletion based on reliance. Compressed data is permanently stored per user for operational purposes. A sample raw data document is available [here](https://github.com/TruckersMP-Tracker/events-tracking/blob/main/json/examples/event_test/raw_test_doc.json).

### Data Usage

The primary purpose is to provide VTCs and organisers with attendance insights. Unauthorized use, as outlined in our [terms](https://github.com/TruckersMP-Tracker/events-tracking/blob/main/docs/terms.md), will result in permanent access removal.

### User Access

Access to all data is strictly limited to authorised users. The only authorised user is "Bean." VTC personnel may request specific user data, receiving the bare minimum required. Public players cannot request access to others' data but may request a JSON dump of their stored data across all our services.

### Security and Confidentiality

Data is secure, not sold to third parties, and sourced through legal and public means. We operate as an individual, not a company.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We retain the right to delete users' data, block users from accessing their data if the way in which they're accessing it contravenes our rules, and to update and remove any of this privacy policy without forewarning or notification. The Effective Date will be updated upon an update.

We may update this policy periodically, with changes effective upon posting the updated policy on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TruckersMP-Tracker/events-tracking). Regularly review this policy for any updates.

### Contact Information

For questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, contact us via GitHub issues or our Discord server.
