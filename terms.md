# TruckersMP Tracker - Events Tracking Terms of Service

## Effective Date: 13/12/2023

By using the TruckersMP Tracker Events Tracking service ("Service"), you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions ("Terms"). Please read these Terms carefully before using the Service.

### Access to the Service

1. **Authorised Users:** Access to the full range of data collected by the Service is strictly limited to authorised users. The only authorised user is "Bean." Other users, including the general public, shall not attempt to access, modify, or manipulate any data beyond what is explicitly made available to them through the Service.

2. **VTC Personnel:** Virtual Trucking Companies (VTCs) may request specific user data for their events. However, they will only be provided with the necessary information to meet their requirements. VTCs shall not attempt to access more data than is required for event-related purposes.

3. **Public Players:** Public players cannot request access to the data of other users. However, public players may request a JSON dump of their stored data across all our services through our Discord bot or website.

### Prohibited Uses

1. **Unauthorized Access:** Users shall not attempt to gain unauthorised access to the Service or its data beyond their designated access permissions.

2. **Data Misuse:** Users shall not use the collected data for any purpose other than its intended use, as outlined in the Service's documentation.

3. **Harassment or Misconduct:** Users shall not use data held by the Service to harass, stalk, insult, gain an advantage over others, or engage in any malicious or unsavoury conduct.

### Event Tracking System Specifics

1. **Data Collection:** The Service employs distinct techniques for event servers and simulation servers. Event servers are meticulously tracked for every player, while simulation servers focus on tracking players in cities or along a route.

2. **Bans at Events:** The Service tracks every ban, checking if an account is banned when a player leaves. Tracking rules apply specifically to event-tracked bans.

3. **When We Don't Track:** Tracking is restricted for specific areas and events that contravene TruckersMP rules. Official events with expected attendance over 250 users have limited data storage.

4. **Tracking Periods:** Tracking starts before the end of 2023, with an automatic start when an event server comes online. We track with a 30-second update interval.

5. **When Tracking Stops:** Tracking ceases two hours after the advertised departure time or when the event server goes offline. Resumption requires a new event. Tracking for individual users may stop upon leaving an event server but resumes on joining another event server.

6. **Data Storage and Retention:** Raw data is retained for 30 days, followed by anonymisation or deletion. Compressed data is stored permanently per user for operational purposes.

### Security and Privacy

1. **Data Security:** The Service employs measures to secure user data and protect it from unauthorised access. Users shall not attempt to circumvent these security measures.

2. **Data Privacy:** The Service respects user privacy, operating in compliance with relevant data protection laws. User data is not sold to third parties and is sourced through legal and public means.

### Termination

1. **Access Removal:** Violation of these Terms resulting in a permanent ban/removal of access is an unappealable punishment. Automatically issued punishments such as rate limits are not covered.

### Changes to the Terms

We retain the right to update, modify, or remove any part of these Terms with forewarning or notification. The Effective Date will be updated upon any changes.
